# 🔮 Developer's Daily Fortune

## What is this socery?

Developer's Daily Fortune is your daily dose of cosmic coding wisdom! It's like a horoscope, but instead of telling you when you'll meet your soulmate, it tells you whether your pull requests will be approved today. (Spoiler: Mercury in retrograde is never good for deployments!)

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Daily Fortunes

- Get a new fortune every 24 hours
- Each fortune comes with:
    - A coding-related prediction
    - Your lucky programming language of the day
    - A recommended development tool for maximum cosmic alignment

### 🤔 Skepticism Mode

For those developers who prefer unit tests over celestial predictions, I've included a "Doubt the Fortune" feature. Because let's face it, what does the compiler know about astrology anyway?

### 📢 Share your Fortune

Spread the cosmic debugging energy! Share your fortune with fellow developers and let them know which language the stars have chosen for you today.

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

- React (because the stars aligned with component-based architecture)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling that's as smooth as a well-formatted JSON)
- LocalStorage (keeping your fortunes persistent, just like your bugs)
- Lucide React Icons (making things pretty, because even cosmic predictions need good UI)

## How it Works

### 1. Fortune Generation

- Each fortune is randomly selected from a curated list of tech-savvy predictions
- A 24-hour cooldown ensures you don't overload the cosmic servers
- LocalStorage remembers your fortune, because who doesn't love persistent state?

### 2. Skepticism Engine

- Toggle between belief and doubt with our state-of-the-art skepticism system
- Randomly generated skeptical responses for those who trust test coverage more than tarot cards

### 3. Share Functionality

- Copies your fortune to clipboard with a fun message
- Perfect for spreading dubious cosmic wisdom across your development team

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository (carefully, Mercury might be in retrograde)
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you're feeling rebellious)
3. Start the project with `npm run dev`
4. Accept your cosmic coding destiny

## 🤨 FAQ

__Q. Is this scientifically accurate?__

A. About as accurate as estimating project timelines.

__Q. Can I get multiple fortunes per day?__

A. Nice try! But just like good code reviews, quality over quantity.

__Q. What if I don't like my fortune?__

A. That's what the skepticism button is for! Also, have you tried turning it off and on again?

__Q. Does it work better if I validate my HTML?__

A. The stars are mysteriously silent on this matter.

## ✌️ Future Cosmic Features (Maybe?)

- Integration with Mercury retrograde API (once I build it)
- AI-powered fortune generation (because why not add more buzzwords?)
- Quantum fortune computation (results may vary based on observation)
